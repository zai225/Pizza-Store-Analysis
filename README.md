# Pizza-Store-Analysis
Welcome to my Pizza Store Data Analysis Project, where I analyzed a Kaggle dataset to uncover insights into Finance, Orders, and Customer Trends using Advanced Excel, Power Query, and Feature Engineering. Key findings include Sales Trends, Top-Selling Pizzas, Peak Order Hours, Customer Patterns, and Profitability Insights.
